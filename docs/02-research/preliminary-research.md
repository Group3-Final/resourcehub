# Preliminary Research: Project Selection Process

## Initial Team Ideation
Our team conducted individual research to generate diverse startup support concepts, resulting in four distinct proposals:

1. **ResourceHub**: A resource management system for tech startups focusing on workspace optimization, development resources, and sustainability tracking.

2. **VentureWise**: An AI-powered platform providing startup guidance, resource optimization, and strategic support.

3. **OutdoorConnect**: A platform facilitating outdoor activities through resource sharing and community building.

4. **BookSwap Points**: A community-driven book exchange platform with a points-based system.

## Evaluation Process
We evaluated each concept against key criteria aligned with the project theme of supporting hi-tech startups:

### ResourceHub (Selected)
- Direct alignment with tech startup needs
- Clear focus on resource optimization
- Integration of development methodologies
- Practical implementation scope
- Strong sustainability component

### VentureWise
+ Comprehensive business support
+ AI integration potential
- Too broad in scope
- Complex implementation requirements

### OutdoorConnect
+ Strong community aspect
+ Resource sharing focus
- Limited tech startup relevance
- Diverges from core theme

### BookSwap Points
+ Clear implementation path
+ Strong sharing economy model
- Not specifically tech-focused
- Limited startup application

## Selection Rationale
ResourceHub was chosen because it:
1. Directly addresses tech startup challenges
2. Has manageable scope for implementation
3. Incorporates key development paradigms
4. Features clear sustainability metrics
5. Supports team collaboration effectively

## Research Methodology
Our research included:
- Analysis of existing startup resource management solutions
- Review of development methodology implementation
- Assessment of sustainability tracking approaches
- Evaluation of team collaboration tools

## Appendix: AI Prompts Used
1. "What are the main challenges tech startups face in resource management?"
2. "How can workspace management support different development methodologies?"
3. "What sustainability metrics are relevant for tech startups?"
4. "Compare existing solutions for startup resource optimization"

This research helped us validate ResourceHub as the most suitable choice for our project scope and requirements.
